 Description
=============
Tombstone - A deadman's chest plugin
Save your players' inventory from disappearing when they die.
I used Deadmans Chest in hMod and thought it was a great plugin, so I started my own version for Bukkit.

 Features
=============
If the player is carrying a chest when they die, place that chest and fill it with as much of their inventory as possible
If the player is allowed, and is carrying two chests, a large chest will spawn to catch all of their inventory
Possible for specific groups/players to be given free chests with no need to carry one with them
Any items that won't fit in the chest will still drop to the ground!
Supports the Permissions plugin, will default to allowing everyone to use tombstone if not available
Supports LWC for chest protection if it is installed
